                <h3>Presently the door commenced</h3>
                <p>"I see no other way, Ja," I said, "though I can assure you
                that I would rather go to Sheol after Perry than to Phutra.
                However, Perry is much too pious to make the probability at all
                great that I should ever be called upon to rescue him from the
                former locality."</p>

                <p>Ja asked me what Sheol was, and when I explained, as best
                I could, he said, "You are speaking of Molop Az, the flaming
                sea upon which Pellucidar floats.  All the dead who are buried
                in the ground go there. Piece by piece they are carried down to
                Molop Az by the little demons who dwell there.  We know this
                because when graves are opened we find that the bodies have
                been partially or entirely borne off.  That is why we of Anoroc
                place our dead in high trees where the birds may find them and
                bear them bit by bit to the Dead World above the Land of Awful
                Shadow.  If we kill an enemy we place his body in the ground
                that it may go to Molop Az."</p>

                <p>Presently the door commenced to recede before me until it
                had sunk into the wall fifty feet, then it stopped and slid
                easily to the left, exposing a short, narrow corridor of
                concrete, at the further end of which was another door, similar
                in every respect to the one I had just passed.  No one was in
                sight, yet immediately we passed the first door it slid gently
                into place behind us and receded rapidly to its original
                position in the front wall of the building.  As the door had
                slipped aside I had noted its great thickness, fully twenty
                feet, and as it reached its place once more after closing
                behind us, great cylinders of steel had dropped from the
                ceiling behind it and fitted their lower ends into apertures
                countersunk in the floor.</p>

                <p>A second and third door receded before me and slipped to one
                side as the first, before I reached a large inner chamber where
                I found food and drink set out upon a great stone table.
                A voice directed me to satisfy my hunger and to feed my calot,
                and while I was thus gaged my invisible host put me through
                a severe and searching cross-examination.</p>

                <p>"Your statements are most remarkable," said the voice, on
                concluding its questioning, "but you are evidently speaking the
                truth, and it is equally evident that you are not of Barsoom.
                I can tell that by the conformation of your brain and the
                strange location of your internal organs and the shape and size
                of your heart."</p>
